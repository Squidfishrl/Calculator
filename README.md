# Calculator
a simple, efficient calculator running in the background, callable via hotkey



# Hotkeys
enter - evaluate expression

escape - clear entry

ctrl+space - hide/call

up - traverse trough history

down - go back



# Notes
Since the calculator uses eval() to calculate expressions, it could also run python code

On linux the script requires root priviliges, due to the key detection library being used requires it

Windows version doesn't include the latest patches
